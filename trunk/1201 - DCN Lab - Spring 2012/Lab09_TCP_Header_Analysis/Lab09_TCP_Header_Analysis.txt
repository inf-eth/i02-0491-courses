Lab 09 Tasks:
* You may need to modify any code following a "TODO"
- Using the packet capturing program provided on SLATE capture and analyze TCP packets exchanged between client and server.
- Display IP and TCP header fields.
- Display the flags in TCP header separately.
- Also print data or payload.
- Note down the client/server sequence numbers and flags. Explain!

* Display UDP packet headers.
- Do the same for UDP packets, i.e. display UDP header fields.
