- Packet tracer is a network simulator software.
- There are two running modes, realtime and simulation.
  - In simulation packets can be viewed at every instant and their routers can be traced.
  - In realtime mode packets travel in real time.

- A simple network can be made by connecting two end devices like PCs with each other using cross cable.
- A switch can be used to make a small network with several PCs as end devices.
- Switch uses mac-address-table to route packets in a network.
