\section{Existence of Electric Charges}
Electric charges exist everywhere in all matter. They come in two varieties, positive and negative. Evidence of electric charges can be observed by rubbing a glass rod with a wool cloth and bringing near strands of hair or pieces of paper.

An amazing fact about electrical charges is that they are always balanced. A potato would violently explode if the charge imbalance in it is anywhere near as small $10^{-10}$. Almost all the forces we observe in our daily life have electromagnetic nature. Pushing an object, elastic force, friction and mechanical forces are just some manifestations of electromagnetic forces at work. These forces are also responsible for states of solids and liquids.
\section{Coulomb's Law}
Force exerted by a charge $q_1$ on another charge $q_2$ can be calculated using Coulomb's Law.
\begin{equation}
\textbf{F}_{12}=\dfrac{q_1q_2}{4\pi\epsilon_0 |\textbf{r}_2-\textbf{r}_1|^3}(\textbf{r}_2-\textbf{r}_1)
\end{equation}
Here $\textbf{r}_1$ and $\textbf{r}_2$ are position vectors of charges $q_1$ and $q_2$, respectively. The magnitude of Coulombic force is given by the seldom used formula
\begin{equation}
\mathrm{F}_{12}=\dfrac{|q_1||q_2|}{4\pi\epsilon_0r^2}
\end{equation}

%\noindent\textbf{Question 1 \cite[Example 23.2, page 713]{Serway}:} Three charges are located at the corners of a right angle triangle as shown in figure \ref{Resultant-force}. Here $q_1=q_3=5~\mu$C, $q_2=-2~\mu$C and $a=0.1$ m. Find the force on $q_1$, $q_2$ and $q_3$.

%\noindent\textbf{Question 2 \cite[Example 23.3, page 714]{Serway}:} Three charges are located in a straight line as shown in figure \ref{Zero-force}. Here $q_1=15~\mu$C and $q_2=6~\mu$C. Given that resultant force on $q_3$ is zero find the location of $q_3$.
