\maketitle
\noindent\textbf{Objectives}
\begin{itemize}
\item[1.] Learn the mechanics of network communication.
\item[2.] TCP and UDP models of network communication.
\item[3.] Use provided libraries to develop TCP or UDP network applications.
\end{itemize}
\noindent\textbf{Question} This assignment requires you to develop a TCP network application. The Server maintains a database of student records in a file. A Client with proper authorisation can connect to Server and perform database operations. Database operations are: add record, display all records, search for a record and update a record. The Client is presented a menu to navigate through these options. Student record structure and menu are given below.
\begin{verbatim}
// Each StudentRecord takes 64 bytes.
struct StudentRecord
{
    char Name[40];
    int Roll;
    int Age;
    float CGPA;
    int CourseMarks[3];
};
\end{verbatim}
\begin{verbatim}
============== Server Menu ==============
1. Add record
   - Input record
2. Display all records
3. Search a record
   - Input student name to search for
4. Update record
   - Input student name to search for
5. Download course outline
6. Disconnect from Server.
=========================================

\noindent\textbf{Considerations:}
\begin{itemize}
\item[-] Server and Client can only use one \verb|StudentRecord| variable each at their ends to perform all operations.
\item[-] All the data is stored in a file \verb|records.rec| at Server.
\item[-] Declare a string to store menu at Server side and send it to Client in a loop.
\item[-] After Server sends the menu to Client it will receive a choice (an integer) and perform requested operation.
\item[-] Keep course outline in a pdf file at Server side. Programming -- I course outline is available at SLATE.
\item[-] Server and Client will both run in infinite loops. Selecting `disconnect' will properly break the loops for both Server and Client so that they can exit.
