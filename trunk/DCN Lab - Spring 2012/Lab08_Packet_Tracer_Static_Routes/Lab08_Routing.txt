- Routers are devices that connect different networks.
- Routers can be used to create and/or different subnets in a larger network.
- Considering a router has two IP-based ports, following rules apply:
  1. Both ports must have different network addresses.
  2. Any packet received on Port 1 with Port 2 network address as destination will be automatically routed to Port 2 network and vice versa.
  3. If router receives a packet whose destination address doesn't match either Port 1 or Port 2 network address then it will be dropped.
- In order to route packets to a different subnet, static routes must be defined and configured.

Lab 08 Tasks:
- Create two switched networks and connect them using a single router.
- Create three switched networks and connect them using three routers.

Homework
- Create 5 networks with following routing rules:
  - Net 1 > Net 2 > Net 3 > Net 5
  - Net 2 > Net 1 > Net 5
  - Net 3 > Net 1 > Net 4
  - Net 4 > Net 3 > Net 5
  - Net 5 > Net 1 > Net 2 > Net 4
  Example: Net 1 can communicate with Net 2, 3 and 5 but not with 4 etc.
