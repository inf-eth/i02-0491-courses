- Using the packet capturing program provided on SLATE (lab 10 folder) capture and analyze HTTP packets exchanged when logging into SLATE.
- You are required to analyze the payload and...
  - Explain the sequence of packets exchanged (GET? POST?) during successful and unsuccessful login requests.
  - Explain the sequence of packets exchanged on logging out.
  - You do not need to explain each and every packet or the whole html code. Only consider any relevant packets and give a very brief explanation of the underlying mechanics.

- Display IP and TCP header fields.
- Display the flags in TCP header separately.
- Also print data or payload.
- Note down the client/server sequence numbers and flags. Explain!
