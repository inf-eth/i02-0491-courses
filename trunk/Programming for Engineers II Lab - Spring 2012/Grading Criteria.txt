Base marks for lab work = 7 marks

Complete one or more from the following to earn extra marks for a maximum of 10 marks
- Complete all lab task(s) within 1 minute = 3 marks
- Complete all lab tasks(s) within 15 minutes = 2 marks
- Complete all lab tasks(s) within 30 minutes = 1 mark
- Help at least one student with his/her errors = 1 mark
- Help at least three students with their errors = 2 marks
- Proper indentation and commenting = 1 mark
- Error checking and input prompts (user friendliness) = 1 mark
- Following naming conventions [1] and good programming practices [2] = 2 marks
- Implement something new [3] and creative = 2 marks
- Complete the task using Linux only = 2 mark
- Automate build process on Linux using a Makefile with build (compile + link), run and clean options = 1 mark
- Hack into neon, slate or Pentagon using a Linux terminal = 3 marks

[1] Naming convention for classes is to place a capital 'C' before every class name, e.g. CComplex or CStudent. Header and implementation files should be named without the preceding 'C', e.g. Complex.h and Complex.cpp respectively.
[2] Using standard headers is example of good programming practice. Error checking is another. For example, consider the following:

1. Nonstandard header.

    #include <iostream.h>


2. Standard header but std namespace is made global violating OOP principles.

    #include <iostream>
    using namespace std;


3. Proper.

    #include <iostream>
    using std::cin;
    using std::cout;


First is not a good programming practice as iostream.h is not a standard C++ header file. Compared to second, third is better because it only uses the functions being used in the program rather than making the whole std namespace global.
[3] 'new' is defined as something never-before-seen-or-heard.
