Important Concepts: Shortest path first, Dijkstra's algorithm, link state routing.

- Link state routing is used by routers on the internet.
- Each router only knows about its neighbours and their distances as they are turned on.
  1. Routers send special packets called Link State Packets to all their neighbours after random time.
  2. The neighbours pass on these packets to all routes/neighbours.
  3. The LS packets have a sequence number and TTL.
  4. LS pakcets are dopped by a router if the sequence number is older than current or TTL expires to prevent flooding.
  5. Routers construct graphs and routing tables based on the information in LS packets.
  6. Distances and shortest routes to each destination is determined using Dijkstra's algorithm on graph.
  7. It will take some time before the graph stabilize. At least ONE LS packet from EACH router must reach ALL routers before every router can construct the final graph and routes.

Lab 12 Tasks:
Compilation: Go into Bin32 folder and type './compile'
Making configuration files:
- Routers can have IDs 5000, 5001, 5002 and so on.
- The filenames 5000.cfg upto 5007.cfg are examples of individual router files.
- There are 8 routers by default.
- You can edit the .cfg files to simulate a certain topology.
  - 5000.cfg means this file is for router 5000. Only router 5000 will read this file.
  - The .cfg file contains number of neighbours followed by their IDs and distances as pairs.
    - E.g. 5000.cfg contains: '3 5001 1 5002 1 5004 1'
    - Router 5000 has 3 neighbours 5001, 5002 and 5004 with distances to each of them being 1, 1 and 1 respectively.
- You need to create as many .cfg files as the number of routers you want to simulate.
- To run a router type '/Router.o 5000 100' where 5000 is the ID of router.
- You need to run all the routers in separate terminals.

Task 1: Analyze LS routing and construct graph from the configuration files provided.
Task 2: Simulate the given network topology and write down shortest routes from each source and destination.
