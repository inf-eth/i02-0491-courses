\maketitle
\section{Announcements}
\begin{itemize}
\item Quiz.
\item Assignment based quiz will be on Friday. All quizzes are by default scheduled for Friday.
\end{itemize}
\section{Revision}
\begin{itemize}
\item C++ classes extend the functionality of structs in C.
\item Difference between classes and objects in C++. Class is the name of data type and object is the variable.
\item It makes more sense to talk about classes on an abstract level.
\item Class \textbf{definition}? Can also be referred as class \textbf{declaration} or \textbf{interface}.
\item Class implementation?
\item Sometimes interface is separate from implementation to differentiate between the two. Separate files?
\item Class functions can defined (implemented) inside or outside the class.
\item Scope resolution operator \verb|::| can be used to define class functions outside the class.
\end{itemize}
\section{Relationship Between Classes}
\subsection{``is a'' Relationship}
\begin{itemize}
\item Car is the base class.
\item Honda \textbf{is a} car.
\item Toyota \textbf{is a} car.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Mobile phone is the base class.
\item Apple iPhone \textbf{is a} mobile phone.
\item Samsung Galaxy \textbf{is a} mobile phone.
\end{itemize}
\begin{itemize}
\item Person is the base class.
\item Teacher \textbf{is a} person.
\item Student \textbf{is a} person.
\end{itemize}
Derived classes have all the features (attributes and functionality) of base class in addition to some features specific to it. A person will have a name and age. A student in addition to name and age will also have a CGPA.
\subsection{``has a'' Relationship}
A class can be in possession of other classes.
\begin{itemize}
\item That teacher \textbf{has a}n Apple iPhone.
\item That student \textbf{has a} Samsung Galaxy.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{``using a'' and ``knows a'' Relationship}
\begin{itemize}
\item A person driving a car is an association between two objects. Person is `using' a car.
\item Student X and talking to student Y because they `know' each other and exchange views.
\item A remote control can interact or talk to AC.
\end{itemize}
\section{\texttt{const} Variables}
\begin{itemize}
\item A variable declared with \verb|const| directive.
\item Value of a constant variable cannot change throughout the execution of a program.
\item Can only be initialised at declaration.
\end{itemize}
\section{\texttt{inline} Functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Functions can be defined as \verb|inline|.
\item This is mainly a compiler level optimisation.
\end{itemize}
\section{Constructor}
\begin{itemize}
\item A constructor is a very special function in a class.
\item Name of constructor is the name of class.
\item It doesn't have a return type. Mentioning a return type is an error.
\item A constructor is called exactly once throughout the life of an object; only at its creation. Actually, just before the creation.
\item The purpose of a constructor is to initialise data members or variables etc.
\item Even if a constructor isn't defined, compiler will create a default constructor which doesn't do anything.
\item A constructor, default or otherwise, will always be called upon object creation.
\item Constructor can take arguments.
\item Different constructors can be defined. They can be differentiated through their argument list.
\end{itemize}
