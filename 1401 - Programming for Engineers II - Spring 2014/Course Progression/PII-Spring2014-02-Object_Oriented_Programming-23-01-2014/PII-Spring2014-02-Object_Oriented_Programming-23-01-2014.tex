\section{Why Do We Need Object--Oriented Programming?\cite{Lafore}}
\begin{itemize}
\item Limitations in earlier programming approaches.
\item Need to understand limitations.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Procedural Languages}
\begin{itemize}
\item C, Pascal, FORTRAN.
\item Procedural approach is to do a single task in a serial manner by executing a set of instructions.
\item This will work for smaller programs. Organisation (or paradigm) isn't needed.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Division into Functions}
\begin{itemize}
\item For relatively large programs a list of instructions may be tedious whenever there is some repetition of code.
\item Functions can make the code readable and reduce repetition.
\item Function can be called a subprogram, subroutine or procedure.
\item Each function has a defined task or purpose in procedural programming in addition to an interface (arguments list and return value).
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Structured Programming}
\begin{itemize}
\item Similar functions can be grouped together to form a \textit{module}.
\item Program division into functions and then modules led to something called \textit{structured programming} before object--oriented approach was developed.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Problems With Structured Programming}
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Unrestricted access:} A lot of functions access same global data. If data is changed functions must be re--written.
\item \textbf{Poor real--world modelling:} Real--world objects (or entities) cannot be described by just data or functionality. They have both \textit{attributes} and \textit{behaviour}.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Real--World Modelling}
\subsubsection{Attributes (Data)}
Attributes of a car can be colour, horsepower, model. A person can have a job description like teacher or student, eye colour, height, age etc.
\subsubsection{Behaviour (Function)}
A car can accelerate or decelerate. A person can talk, eat and sleep.
\section{The Object--Oriented Approach}
\begin{itemize}
\item Create a single unit that encloses \textit{data} and the \textit{functions that operate on that data}. Also called \textit{data encapsulation}.
\item This is called an \textit{object}.
\item An object's functions are the only way to access its data. You have to ask a person his name and he/she can choose to tell or not to tell you his/her name.
\item The data is \textit{hidden} to prevent accidental alteration.
\item \textit{Data hiding} and \textit{data encapsulation} are key terms in object--oriented languages.
\item Since you know exactly which functions will operate on data this simplifies writing, debugging and maintaining the program.
\item In C++, objects communicate with each other through their member functions.
\subsection{Example}
Different departments in an organisation do their specific tasks. They have their own records to maintain and only the concerned people from a particular department can modify records.
\end{itemize}
\section{UML}
UML stands for Unified Modelling Language. This is a standardised graphical language meant for graphical representation of a problem.
\section{C and C++}
\begin{itemize}
\item C++ extends the functionality of C to implement OOP.
\item C++ also adds some features on top of C.
\item Since the emphasis in C++ is that of OOP, some C features are seldom if ever used. There are several C++ alternatives to C functions in order to follow the OOP approach.
\end{itemize}
\section{A Simple CGPA Calclator}
\begin{lstlisting}[caption={CGPA Calculator}]
#include <iostream> // Input/output stream library.
using namespace std;
int main()
{
	float C1, C2, C3, C4, C5, CGPA;		// Variable declaration.
	cout << "Enter course grades: ";	// Message to input grades.
	cin >> C1 >> C2 >> C3 >> C4 >> C5;	// Input.
	CGPA = (C1+C2+C3+C4+C5)/5;			// CGPA calculation.
	cout << "CGA is " << CGPA << endl;	// Displaying CGPA.
	
	return 0;
