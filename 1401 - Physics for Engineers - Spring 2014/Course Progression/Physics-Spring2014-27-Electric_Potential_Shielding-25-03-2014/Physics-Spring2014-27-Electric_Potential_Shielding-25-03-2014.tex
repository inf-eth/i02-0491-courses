\section{Shielding}
There are two kinds of shielding.
\begin{enumerate}
\item When you want to isolate some sensitive equipment from outside interference you enclose that equipment in a metallic casing. The device may emit radiation but it won't be affected by any field outside the metallic cage (Faraday's cage). Example is a +q charge placed inside a (neutral) metallic shell.
\item When you want to eliminate electromagnetic radiation: If a positive charge +q is covered with metallic shell having -q charge then no field will exist outside the shell. In this kind of shielding +q charge will not be affected any field outside the shell. Also, there won't be any field outside the shell. Example is coaxial cable, inner conductor carries +ve current and outer conductor carries -ve current and there is not field outside the wire.
\end{enumerate}
\section{Electric Potential}
Suppose an electric field exists in some region. We take a charge $q$ and move it around. We know that a force $\textbf{F}=q\textbf{E}$ will act on the charge. If we want to move the charge from point A to point B then the total amount of work that must be done by us (to overcome the field) is given by
\begin{equation}
W=\Delta U=U_B-U_A=-q\int\limits_{a}^{b} \textbf{E}\cdot d\textbf{\textit{l}}.
\end{equation}
Here $\Delta U$ is the energy difference between points A and B as we move a charge $q$. \textbf{Electric field stores energy} and a detailed discussion will have to be deferred for later. From here we define another quantity called electric potential (V).
\begin{equation}
V=\dfrac{U}{q}.
\end{equation}
Or
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=\dfrac{\Delta U}{q}.
\end{equation}
To calculate potential difference between two points, A and B, in electric field \textbf{E}
\begin{equation}
\Delta V=V_{AB}=V_B-V_A=-\int\limits_{a}^{b} \textbf{E}\cdot d\textbf{\textit{l}}.
\end{equation}
Notice, that just as electric field was a fundamental quantity where we can find force on \textit{any} charge $q$ by simply multiplying it with \textbf{E}, electric potential is also a fundamental quantity where we can find the energy difference between two points, A and B, by simply multiplying $q$ with $V_{AB}$. $W=\Delta U=U_{AB}=qV_{AB}$ gives the amount of work that must be done in moving \textit{any} charge $q$ from A to B in electric field.
\section{Absolute Potential}
Absolute potential at some point B is the potential difference at B with respect to infinity. Or, it is the potential difference between A and B when point A or initial point is at infinity. Absolute potential is a useful standard reference point that can be used to define a potential scalar field. Remember, electric potential is a scalar quantity.
\begin{equation}
V_B=-\int\limits_{\infty}^{b} \textbf{E}\cdot d\textbf{\textit{l}}.
\end{equation}
Note, when referring to electric potential as `potential at some point' or simply `potential' then this usually means absolute electric potential at that point.
\section{Exercises}
\noindent\textbf{Question 1:} Electric field in a region is $\textbf{E}=\dfrac{1}{4\pi\epsilon_0x^2}\hat x$ V/m. Find absolute potential $V_b$ at a point $x=b$.\\[0.2cm]
